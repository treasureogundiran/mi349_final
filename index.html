        Assembled during a confrontation with Loki, the Avengers formed to
        protect the Earth and its citizens from various criminals and
        international threats. Its roster included Captain America, Iron Man,
        Black Widow, Hawkeye, Thor and Hulk. Ant-Man was also a member of the
        team, though left due to pressure from Stark. Carol Danvers was also an
        ally and a member, using the mantles of both Ms. Marvel and Captain
        Marvel. At some point, Barton also left the team, possibly to train
        fellow archer Kate Bishop to become his successor.

          >
            Born on July 4th, 1920 in Brooklyn, Steve Rogers was the subject of
            the United States Army's Project: Rebirth. He was transformed into
            the first of what was planned to be the army's super-soldiers, but
            he was the only successful creation, due to disruption by enemy
            forces. Taking the title of Captain America, Rogers fought primarily
            in Europe against the Axis forces, notably the Nazis. During his
            time there, he received help from various allied forces including US
            Corporal Clarence Davis and was given a magnetized Vibranium shield.
            Steve was also romantically involved with British Agent Peggy
            Carter. Rogers was also a long-time ally of Azzuri, the World War
            II's Black Panther, and thereby Wakanda's long-time ally. During the
            final days of the war, Captain America was frozen in the arctic
            during one of his missions. Rather than dying, the super soldier
            formula cryogenically froze him, though he remained unfound for
            decades. At some point in the 21st century, Rogers was discovered by
            the Avengers, who thawed him out of the ice. Joining the team, he
            continued to operate as Captain America and battled a new variety of
            enemies. Rogers was also responsible for bring Wakanda into
            international diplomatic relations through its current Black
            Panther, T'Challa.

            The son of technology mogul Howard Stark and his wife Maria, Tony
            inherited the business after their deaths. While making his own for
            the company, he also finalized the designs of his late father's
            designs, including that of the Helicarriers and nuclear warfare.
            Initially developing weapons technology for organizations like
            SHIELD, Stark turned a blind eye to those using it, believing he was
            not responsible for how his technology was used. At some point, he
            was romantically involved with his secretary Pepper Potts, though it
            presumably ended badly. After a brush with death, Stark decided to
            become involved in personally protecting civilians from hostile
            threats. To achieve this, he developed an armored suit fitted with
            many technologies, including Repulsors and an Arc Reactor. Taking
            the identity Iron Man, he became a founding member of the Avengers
            after an encounter with Loki. During his time on the team, Stark
            worked alongside Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Ant-Man,
            Thor, Captain Marvel and the Hulk. Stark was also the creator of the
            artificial intelligence JARVIS, which assisted the team in their
            operations.

          <blockquote cite="https://marvels-avengers.fandom.com/wiki/Thor">
            As the son of Odin, Thor Odinson grew up on the realm of Asgard. A
            skilled warrior and blessed with the ability to control lightning,
            he was worshipped by the Norse people of Midgard, who dubbed him the
            "God of Thunder and Wind". Thor also wielded the hammer Mjolnir as a
            weapon, using it to channel the Odinforce. Thor also visited the
            Earth on several occasions and was aware of the Kree Empire, At some
            point, Thor was banished to Earth by his father to teach him
            humility. Whilst there, he became involved with other heroes when
            his adopted brother Loki began wrecking havoc in an unspecified
            event. This led to the foundation of the Avengers, which Thor became
            a member of. During his time on the team, he worked alongside Iron
            Man, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Ant-Man, the Hulk and Carol Danvers. Thor
            was among the Avengers that discovered Captain America and, upon
            reviving him, received a hard punch from the super-soldier. He
            quickly grew to respect the super-soldier and regarded him as a
            better man than himself. Thor's banishment to Earth also ended at
            some point, which led to him being granted access to its Bifrost.

          <blockquote cite="https://marvels-avengers.fandom.com/wiki/Hulk">
            Not much is known about Bruce Banner's past, though he went to "grad
            school" in New Mexico. During his time there, he became acquainted
            with fellow student, Monica Rappaccini, who he regarded as one of
            the greatest minds he'd ever met. Afterwards, he received a
            doctorate specializing in Gamma Radiation. Several months later,
            Banner was transformed into a human mutate during an experiment with
            gamma radiation. Under high amounts of physical or mental stress, he
            would turn into a giant green humanoid being with enhanced strength,
            durability and a separate but more aggressive personality, which
            many dubbed "the Hulk". Banner saw the Hulk as a curse and would
            transform even in the most normal of situations, such as airplane
            flights, and sometimes would not be able to determine which was in
            charge. Hoping to get rid of his alter ego, he worked to investigate
            Hulk about what triggered him and whether he could do so. At some
            point, Banner joined a team called the Avengers, though it is
            unclear whether it was for use of the Hulk or as a consultant for
            them. As a member, he worked alongside Captain America, Iron Man,
            Black Widow, Hawkeye, Ant-Man, Thor, and Captain Marvel. Through the
            team's allies in SHIELD, Banner was able to gain access to resources
            that allowed him to further investigate Hulk and what caused his
            transformations. He was also able to gain control of the "big guy",
            leading to his use on missions.

            Originating from Russia, Natasha Romanoff was selected to become a
            spy at the age of five. Trained in the Red Room program, she learned
            various skills in espionage and combat. During her time in training,
            Natasha learned not to make friends or trust anyone, including her
            comrades. Natasha was also taught ballet by Special Services agent
            Iosif Stepanov, who treated her kindly compared to her other
            trainers. In her later life, Natasha regarded him as her best
            teacher. As she grew up, she developed her own form of combat,
            mixing the skills Stepanov had taught her with various martial arts.
            Upon reaching adulthood, Natasha was cleared to operate for their
            government. Given the codename "Black Widow", she operated around
            the world on various missions, posing a ballet dancer. At some
            point, Natasha learned that Stepanov had been captured by the
            organization SHIELD for acting as a mule for a diamond smuggling
            operation. This, coupled with disillusionment with the Russian
            government, led her to defect to the organization. Though genuine on
            her alignment, Natasha secretly planned to help him escape and
            settle down far from any governments' reach. Despite her past, she
            was allowed to join and train as an officer. Though she agreed with
            the government's ideals, Natasha refused to follow them blindly.

            Fury to assist the Avengers in the field on several missions.
